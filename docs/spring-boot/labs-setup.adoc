. Copy the _Clone with HTTPS_ url to your clipboard and clone these projects to a working directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd <your-working-directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/eitansuez/spring-boot-labs.git
$ cd spring-boot-labs
----

Optionally, import these projects into your IDE.

For STS, select menu:File[Import...], then select Maven -> Existing Maven Projects. On the _Import Maven Projects_ page, browse to your `spring-boot-labs` directory. Make sure all projects are selected, and click btn:[Finish].
