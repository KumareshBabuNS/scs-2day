= Client Side Load Balancing
:api_endpoint: api.sys.gcp.esuez.org

== What You Will Learn

* How to use Ribbon as a client side load balancer
* How to use a Ribbon enabled `RestTemplate`

== Start the foundation services

. Start the `config-server` in a terminal window.  You may have terminal windows still open from previous labs.  They may be reused for this lab.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd config-server
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. Start the `service-registry`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd service-registry
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. Start two instances of the `fortune-service`, as follows:
+
.. Start your first instance as usual:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd fortune-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
This will give us a running fortune-service on http://localhost:8787/[^]

.. Start a second instance by picking a different port for the second instance to listen on:
+
[alternatives#server_port]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-server_port-1.server_port]
--
[source.terminal]
----
SERVER_PORT=8788 mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
[#tabs-server_port-2.server_port]
--
[source,bash]
----
$ set SERVER_PORT=8788
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
--

.. Now check the eureka dashboard at http://localhost:8761/[^] and verify that you have two local instances of the fortune service running

== Set up `greeting-ribbon`

_No additions to the pom.xml_

In this case, we don't need to explicitly include Ribbon support in the `pom.xml`.  Ribbon support is pulled in through transitive dependencies (dependencies of the dependencies we have already defined).

. Review the class `greeting-ribbon/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java`.  Notice the `loadBalancerClient`.  It is a client-side load balancer (Ribbon).  Review the `fetchFortuneServiceUrl()` method.  Ribbon is integrated with Eureka so that it can discover services as well.  Notice how the `loadBalancerClient` chooses a service instance by name.
+
[source.small,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eitansuez/spring-cloud-services-labs/master/greeting-ribbon/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java[]
----

. Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon` app.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd greeting-ribbon
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` dashboard http://localhost:8761[^].  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon` app is registered.

. Browse to the `greeting-ribbon` application at http://localhost:8080/[^].  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  As you refresh the greeting-ribbon app's main page, observe the log output for `greeting-ribbon` in the terminal.  Inspect the logged `uri` and `serviceId` values.  You should see these go back and forth between the two `fortune-service` instances, in round-robin fashion.  Ribbon is doing client-side load balancing!

. Stop the `greeting-ribbon` application.


== Set up `greeting-ribbon-rest`

. Review the class `greeting-ribbon-rest/src/main/java/io/pivotal/GreetingRibbonRestApplication.java`.  In addition to the standard `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation, we're also configuring a `RestTemplate` bean.  It is not the usual `RestTemplate`, it is load balanced by Ribbon.  The `@LoadBalanced` annotation is a qualifier to ensure we get the load balanced `RestTemplate` injected.  This further simplifies application code.
+
[source.small,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eitansuez/spring-cloud-services-labs/master/greeting-ribbon-rest/src/main/java/io/pivotal/GreetingRibbonRestApplication.java[]
----

. Review the class `GreetingController.java`.  Here we autowire the restTemplate we configured in the previous step.  Note also that the spring cloud API is smart enough to dynamically substitute the name of the service `fortune-service` in the url parameter for `getForObject` with its load-balanced, discovered url.
+
[source.small,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eitansuez/spring-cloud-services-labs/master/greeting-ribbon-rest/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java[]
----

. Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd greeting-ribbon-rest
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
----

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` dashboard at http://localhost:8761[^].  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.

. Browse to http://localhost:8080/[^] to the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  Refresh as desired.  Review the terminal output for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.

. More interestingly, review the logs for the two `fortune-service` applications.  With each refresh of greeting-ribbon-rest, one of these two will serve the response, in alternating fashion.

. When done stop the `fortune-service` and `greeting-ribbon-rest` applications (leave config-server and eureka running).

== Customize the Load Balancing Rule

Load balancing is currently taking place according to the default round-robin load balancing rule.  Let's configure `greeting-ribbon-rest` to use a `WeightedResponseTimeRule` instead.

We can simulate two instances of `fortune-service` with different response times by using an artificial delay in the response for one of our two `fortune-service` instances.  The fortune service has been configured with the property (or environment variable) `DELAY_MS` to allow us to do just that.

. Start two instances of `fortune-service` once more, but this time, as follows:
+
[source.terminal]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
..and:
+
[alternatives#delay_ms]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-delay_ms-1.delay_ms]
--
[source.terminal]
----
SERVER_PORT=8788 DELAY_MS=1000 mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
[#tabs-delay_ms-2.delay_ms]
--
[source,bash]
----
$ set SERVER_PORT=8788
$ set DELAY_MS=1000
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
At this point you can verify once more that you have two instances of `fortune-service` registered with Eureka, and that one of them takes longer to respond than the other.

. Write a custom spring `@Configuration` class that customizes the specific implementation of the `IRule` interface that Ribbon should use.  Reference either the Ribbon presentation slides or the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-netflix/1.3.0.RELEASE/[spring cloud netflix documentation^] to review how to do this.
+
Here's one possible implementation:
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import com.netflix.loadbalancer.IRule;
import com.netflix.loadbalancer.WeightedResponseTimeRule;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.ribbon.RibbonClient;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@RibbonClient(name = "main", configuration = RibbonConfiguration.class)
public class RibbonConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public IRule loadBalanceStrategy() {
    return new WeightedResponseTimeRule();
  }
}
----

. Now start your `greeting-ribbon-rest` application once more, and refresh the page to see ribbon again load-balance requests across the two `fortune-service` instances.  This time however, you'll see the more responsive instance utilized more often.  You should also see `greeting-ribbon-rest` log messages indicating that a background job is running that computes updated response times from each instance.

. Congratulations!  You've now configured Ribbon with a custom load balancing rule.  You can now stop the `config-server`, `service-registry`, `fortune-service` and `greeting-ribbon-rest` applications.


== Deploy the `greeting-ribbon-rest` to PCF

=== PCF and the Eureka Registration Method

In the previous lab, we used the `route` registration method. This had the effect of giving client applications the same url for all application instances.  This setting defeats Ribbon, in that no matter which application instance we select, we end up with the same application url, which by definition will be routed through the PCF GoRouter.

In order to bypass the GoRouter and leverage Ribbon, the registration method has to be set to `direct`.

When using the `direct` registration method, all application instances register their internal IP address and port number with Eureka.  This can be a problem in PCF however, for a number of reasons:

* Cloud Foundry may not be configured for direct container-to-container networking,
* Even with container-to-container networking enabled, platform security policy may not allow applications to call one another directly

A new feature of PCF version 1.10 known as "container-to-container" networking, provides a mechanism for an operator for applications to call each other directly by IP address, effectively bypassing the GoRouter.

A recent https://content.pivotal.io/blog/building-spring-microservices-with-cloud-foundrys-new-container-networking-stack[blog post^] by Chris Sterling gives a great overview of how this feature works together with Spring Cloud Services.

Assuming you're working with an instance of Cloud Foundry that has direct networking enabled, let's begin by modifying our application configuration:

. In your `app-config` git repository, locate `application.yml`

. Modify the value of the property `spring.cloud.services.registrationMethod` from `route` to `direct`

. Commit and push your changes back to your github repository

. Finally, restart your running `fortune-service` instances, to cause them to re-register with eureka using their IP addresses:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart fortune-service
----


=== Deploy 'greeting-ribbon-rest'

. Package and push the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push greeting-ribbon-rest -p target/greeting-ribbon-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 512M --random-route --no-start
----

. Bind services for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest config-server
----
+
..and:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest service-registry
----
+
You can safely ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message from the CLI.  We don't need to restage at this time.

. Set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application (our PCF instance is using self-signed SSL certificates).
+
[source.terminal,subs=attributes+]
----
cf set-env greeting-ribbon-rest TRUST_CERTS {api_endpoint}
----
+
You can safely ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message from the CLI.  We don't need to restage at this time.

. Start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf start greeting-ribbon-rest

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry`.  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.

[TIP]
====

Instead of deploying `greeting-ribbon-rest` as described above, did you consider using a CloudFoundry manifest?  Below is an example (please don't copy verbatim;  for one, you'll likely want to change the value for `host`).

[source.small,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ribbon-rest
  path: target/greeting-ribbon-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  host: eitan-grr
  memory: 512M
  services:
  - config-service
  - discovery-service
  env:
    TRUST_CERTS: {api_endpoint}
----

Manifest files simplify the task of deploying an application, and a single `cf push` command can replace the multiple individual cf commands we had to invoke above.

Did you notice how each microservice is registering using its direct IP address?

This gives Ribbon a distinct url for each application instance, allowing it to control load balancing.

One advantage of direct networking between microservices is that we are no longer forced to create a publicly accessible route to backing services.  By removing these routes, we ensure that these services are always accessed via other microservices.  In other words, they can be made inaccessible to direct calls from outside Cloud Foundry.

For more details, please read the http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/1-2/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#register-a-service[following^].
****

Refresh the `greeting-ribbon-rest` root endpoint.

This should fail.

In a nutshell, you'll need to do two things:

. Install the https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/CLI.md[Network Policy Plugin^] for the CF CLI

. Once the plugin is installed, invoke the following command to allow direct communication from the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application to the `fortune-service` application:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf allow-access greeting-ribbon-rest fortune-service --protocol tcp --port 8080
----

Now retry refreshing the `greeting-ribbon-rest` root endpoint.  If `fortune-service` is still scaled at three instances, you should see Ribbon load balance requests across these instances.

.How do you tell if calls to fortune-service are load-balanced?
****

Here's one way:  in the log output below for `fortune-service`, look at the text inside the first set of square brackets:

[source.small,bash]

Did you notice how the instance index is reliably cycling from 2 to 0 to 1?

In the log output above, did you also notice how there are no log messages with the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#rtr[RTR^] log type?  This is not a coincidence.  It is because the calls from `greeting-ribbon-rest` to `fortune-service` are direct:  they no longer travel via the GoRouter.
