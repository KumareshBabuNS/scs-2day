= Client Side Load Balancing
:api_endpoint: api.sys.gcp.esuez.org

== What You Will Learn

* How to use Ribbon as a client side load balancer
* How to use a Ribbon enabled `RestTemplate`

== Start the foundation services

. Start the `config-server` in a terminal window.  You may have terminal windows still open from previous labs.  They may be reused for this lab.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd config-server
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. Start the `service-registry`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd service-registry
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. Start two instances of the `fortune-service`, as follows:
+
.. Start your first instance as usual:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd fortune-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
This will give us a running fortune-service on http://localhost:8787/[^]

.. Start a second instance by picking a different port for the second instance to listen on:
+
[alternatives#server_port]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-server_port-1.server_port]
--
[source.terminal]
----
SERVER_PORT=8788 mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
[#tabs-server_port-2.server_port]
--
[source,bash]
----
$ set SERVER_PORT=8788
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
--

.. Now check the eureka dashboard at http://localhost:8761/[^] and verify that you have two local instances of the fortune service running

== Set up `greeting-ribbon`

_No additions to the pom.xml_

In this case, we don't need to explicitly include Ribbon support in the `pom.xml`.  Ribbon support is pulled in through transitive dependencies (dependencies of the dependencies we have already defined).

. Review the class `greeting-ribbon/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java`.  Notice the `loadBalancerClient`.  It is a client-side load balancer (Ribbon).  Review the `fetchFortuneServiceUrl()` method.  Ribbon is integrated with Eureka so that it can discover services as well.  Notice how the `loadBalancerClient` chooses a service instance by name.
+
[source.small,java]
----
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

  Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

  @Autowired
  private LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient;

  @RequestMapping("/")
  String getGreeting(Model model) {

    logger.debug("Adding greeting");
    model.addAttribute("msg", "Greetings!!!");


    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    String fortune = restTemplate.getForObject(fetchFortuneServiceUrl(), String.class);

    logger.debug("Adding fortune");
    model.addAttribute("fortune", fortune);

    //resolves to the greeting.vm velocity template
    return "greeting";
  }

  private String fetchFortuneServiceUrl() {
    ServiceInstance instance = loadBalancerClient.choose("fortune-service");

    logger.debug("uri: {}", instance.getUri().toString());
    logger.debug("serviceId: {}", instance.getServiceId());

    return instance.getUri().toString();
  }

}
----

. Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon` app.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd greeting-ribbon
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` dashboard http://localhost:8761[^].  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon` app is registered.

. Browse to the `greeting-ribbon` application at http://localhost:8080/[^].  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  As you refresh the greeting-ribbon app's main page, observe the log output for `greeting-ribbon` in the terminal.  Inspect the logged `uri` and `serviceId` values.  You should see these go back and forth between the two `fortune-service` instances, in round-robin fashion.  Ribbon is doing client-side load balancing!

. Stop the `greeting-ribbon` application.


== Set up `greeting-ribbon-rest`

. Review the class `greeting-ribbon-rest/src/main/java/io/pivotal/GreetingRibbonRestApplication.java`.  In addition to the standard `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation, we're also configuring a `RestTemplate` bean.  It is not the usual `RestTemplate`, it is load balanced by Ribbon.  The `@LoadBalanced` annotation is a qualifier to ensure we get the load balanced `RestTemplate` injected.  This further simplifies application code.
+
[source.small,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class GreetingRibbonRestApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(GreetingRibbonRestApplication.class, args);
  }

  @LoadBalanced
  @Bean
  RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
  }

}
----

. Review the class `GreetingController.java`.  Here we autowire the restTemplate we configured in the previous step.  Note also that the spring cloud API is smart enough to dynamically substitute the name of the service `fortune-service` in the url parameter for `getForObject` with its load-balanced, discovered url.
+
[source.small,java]
----
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

  Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

  @Autowired
  private RestTemplate restTemplate;

  @RequestMapping("/")
  String getGreeting(Model model) {

    logger.debug("Adding greeting");
    model.addAttribute("msg", "Greetings!!!");

    String fortune = restTemplate.getForObject("http://fortune-service", String.class);

    logger.debug("Adding fortune");
    model.addAttribute("fortune", fortune);

    //resolves to the greeting.vm velocity template
    return "greeting";
  }

}
----

. Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd greeting-ribbon-rest
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
----

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` dashboard at http://localhost:8761[^].  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.

. Browse to http://localhost:8080/[^] to the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  Refresh as desired.  Review the terminal output for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.

. More interestingly, review the logs for the two `fortune-service` applications.  With each refresh of greeting-ribbon-rest, one of these two will serve the response, in alternating fashion.

. When done stop the `fortune-service` and `greeting-ribbon-rest` applications (leave config-server and eureka running).

== Customize the Load Balancing Rule

Load balancing is currently taking place according to the default round-robin load balancing rule.  Let's configure `greeting-ribbon-rest` to use a `WeightedResponseTimeRule` instead.

We can simulate two instances of `fortune-service` with different response times by using an artificial delay in the response for one of our two `fortune-service` instances.  The fortune service has been configured with the property (or environment variable) `DELAY_MS` to allow us to do just that.

. Start two instances of `fortune-service` once more, but this time, as follows:
+
[source.terminal]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
..and:
+
[alternatives#delay_ms]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-delay_ms-1.delay_ms]
--
[source.terminal]
----
SERVER_PORT=8788 DELAY_MS=1000 mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
[#tabs-delay_ms-2.delay_ms]
--
[source,bash]
----
$ set SERVER_PORT=8788
$ set DELAY_MS=1000
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
--
+
At this point you can verify once more that you have two instances of `fortune-service` registered with Eureka, and that one of them takes longer to respond than the other.

. Write a custom spring `@Configuration` class that customizes the specific implementation of the `IRule` interface that Ribbon should use.  Reference either the Ribbon presentation slides or the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-netflix/1.3.0.RELEASE/[spring cloud netflix documentation^] to review how to do this.
+
Here's one possible implementation:
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import com.netflix.loadbalancer.IRule;
import com.netflix.loadbalancer.WeightedResponseTimeRule;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.ribbon.RibbonClient;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@RibbonClient(name = "main", configuration = RibbonConfiguration.class)
public class RibbonConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public IRule loadBalanceStrategy() {
    return new WeightedResponseTimeRule();
  }
}
----

. Now start your `greeting-ribbon-rest` application once more, and refresh the page to see ribbon again load-balance requests across the two `fortune-service` instances.  This time however, you'll see the more responsive instance utilized more often.  You should also see `greeting-ribbon-rest` log messages indicating that a background job is running that computes updated response times from each instance.

. Congratulations!  You've now configured Ribbon with a custom load balancing rule.  You can now stop the `config-server`, `service-registry`, `fortune-service` and `greeting-ribbon-rest` applications.


== Deploy the `greeting-ribbon-rest` to PCF

. Package and push the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push greeting-ribbon-rest -p target/greeting-ribbon-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 512M --random-route --no-start
----

. Bind services for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest config-server
----
+
..and:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest service-registry
----
+
You can safely ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message from the CLI.  We don't need to restage at this time.

. Set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application (our PCF instance is using self-signed SSL certificates).
+
[source.terminal,subs=attributes+]
----
cf set-env greeting-ribbon-rest TRUST_CERTS {api_endpoint}
----
+
You can safely ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message from the CLI.  We don't need to restage at this time.

. Start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf start greeting-ribbon-rest
----

. After the a few moments, check the `service-registry`.  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.

. Refresh the `greeting-ribbon-rest` root endpoint.  If you've still got the fortune service scaled at three instances, you should see the same round-robin load balancing behavior as earlier, but this time in CloudFoundry.

[TIP]
.How do you tell if calls to fortune-service are load-balanced?

Here's one way:  look at the text inside the first set of square brackets in the log output below (for fortune-service):

See how the instance index is reliably cycling from 2 to 0 to 1?

[TIP]
====

Did you consider instead of the above, using a cloudfoundry manifest to describe how to deploy greeting-ribbon-rest?  Below is an example (please don't copy verbatim;  for one, you'll likely want to change the value for `host`).

[source.small,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ribbon-rest
  path: target/greeting-ribbon-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  host: eitan-grr
  memory: 512M
  services:
  - config-service
  - discovery-service
  env:
    TRUST_CERTS: {api_endpoint}
----

With such a file, the deployment simplifies back down to a single `cf push`.

.Note About This Lab
****
In the previous lab, we configured all applications to use the property _spring.cloud.services.registrationMethod_ with the value _direct_ (if you recall, we did this by editing the `application.yml` file in the config server's git repository).

Observe the PCF discovery service dashboard and you'll notice that each microservice is registering using its direct ip address.

[.thumb]
image::eureka_direct.png[Eureka Dashboard,640]

This allows Ribbon to effectively load-balance directly across the running fortune-service instances without going through the PCF GoRouter.

The other registration method ("route") does the opposite:  every fortune-service instance registers with its formal route url, which in this case would defeat Ribbon:  all requests would traverse the PCF GoRouter, who would now be responsible for the load balancing.

For more details, please read the http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/1-2/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#register-a-service[following^].
