= Sleuth and Zipkin:  Distributed Tracing

In this lab, we'll use Spring Cloud Sleuth to correlate a call trace that starts at the zuul gateway, continues through to the greeting hystrix application, and on to the fortune service, and back.  We'll also use http://zipkin.io/[Zipkin^] to visualize a distributed trace.

It's worthwhile taking a little time to familiarize yourself with distributed tracing http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/1.2.0.RELEASE/#_terminology[terminology^].


== Add the Zipkin Client dependency to our services

Add this dependency to each of the three applications: `zuul-gateway`, `greeting-hystrix`, and `fortune-service`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This dependency does two things:

. it instruments calls across multiple microservices so that log messages have trace and span id's which can be used to correlate these calls
. it sends trace and span information to a zipkin collector service.


Next, configure these applications to send 100% of their traces to zipkin, by adding this parameter to each application's `application.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  sleuth:
    sampler:
      percentage: 1.0
----


== Setup a Zipkin Collector application to visualize traces

Follow the http://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart[quick-start instructions^] for Zipkin to stand up a java zipkin server on port 9411.


== Start up "all the things"

As usual, let's stand up our system, starting with:

- config-server
- service-registry
- the above zipkin server

Then our services:

- fortune-service
- greeting-hystrix

And finally our edge service:

- zuul-gateway

Let's make sure that everything is working as intended:

- Visit the http://localhost:8787/[fortune-service^] a few times in a browser
- Visit the http://localhost:8080/[greeting application^] a few times and make sure it can connect to the fortune service to render fortunes
- Visit the same greeting app, but this time http://localhost:8200/greeting-hystrix[via our zuul gateway^].  Refresh the page 3-4 times for good measure.


== Check out the Zipkin Server UI

Visit the http://localhost:9411/[Zipkin UI^] in a browser.  You might have to wait up to a minute.  Since our applications have been configured with the zipkin client dependency, they will attempt by default to send their trace data to the zipkin server.

From the pulldown menu, select the `zuul-gateway` service, and click btn:[Find Traces].  The search results should display a trace of the "end-to-end" call across all three services, as shown below.

image::zipkin-find-traces.png[Zipkin UI,640]

Now, drill down into that trace by clicking on the listed trace, and you should see a visualization similar to the one shown here:

image::zipkin-trace.png[Zipkin UI,640]

Aside from the basic call trace, note that call duration information is displayed (e.g. 3ms spent in the fortune service).  Also, there's color-coding at play:  any calls that throw an exception will display in dark red instead of blue (which signifies a successful call).  Clicking on the trace will display a popup window containing even more information about this trace.

As the number of microservices in our ecosystem grows, such trace visualizations become indispensable to help make sense of our system's behavior.  Second, it also allows us to study durations and how much time is spent inside each microservice.  It becomes a tool for troubleshooting latency.

Click on the *Dependencies* tab in the header.  You should see a visualization of the call graph, similar to this:

== Write a Custom Span

Let's assume that we wish to know precisely how long the `GreetingController` in `greeting-hystrix` takes to fetch a fortune.  We can do this by wrapping the call to `fortuneService.getFortune()` in a custom span.

Do the following:

. In `greeting-hystrix`, navigate to `GreetingController`
. Refactor: extract the call to `fortuneService.getFortune()` into a separate (new) method, called fetchFortune()
. Autowire a spring cloud sleuth `Tracer` bean into your controller
. Enhance the new method `fetchFortune` to use the tracer to create a new span named `fetchFortune`, and to close that span in a `try/finally` clause after the invocation to `getFortune()`

The finished implementation of GreetingController should look like this:

[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.greeting;

import io.pivotal.fortune.FortuneService;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Span;
import org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Tracer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

  private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

  private final FortuneService fortuneService;
  private final Tracer tracer;

  public GreetingController(FortuneService fortuneService, Tracer tracer) {
    this.fortuneService = fortuneService;
    this.tracer = tracer;
  }

  @RequestMapping("/")
  String getGreeting(Model model) {

    logger.debug("Adding greeting");
    model.addAttribute("msg", "Greetings!!!");

    String fortune = fetchFortune();

    logger.debug("Adding fortune");
    model.addAttribute("fortune", fortune);

    return "greeting"; // resolves to the greeting.ftl template
  }

  private String fetchFortune() {
    Span span = tracer.createSpan("fetchFortune");
    try {
      return fortuneService.getFortune();
    } finally {
      tracer.close(span);
    }
  }

}
----

Now do the following:

. stop and re-run the revised `greeting-hystrix` application
. visit the zuul `greeting-hystrix` endpoint a few times, and finally
. pull up the distributed trace in the zipkin server

You should now see an additional span named _fetchFortune_ displayed in the trace, like this:

[.thumb]
image::zipkin-new-span.png[Zipkin Custom Span,640]

The sleuth API also provides ways to:

. log specific events in the process of handling a request, so that timings can be collected around durations between events, and
. tag spans with specific keywords, so that they can be searched for and easily found in the zipkin ui.

Congratulations!  You've completed this lab.
