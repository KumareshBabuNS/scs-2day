= Sleuth and Zipkin:  Distributed Tracing

Let's use Spring Cloud Sleuth to visualize a call trace that starts at the zuul gateway, continues through to the greeting hystrix application, and on to the fortune service, and back.

== Add the Zipkin Client dependency to our services

Add this dependency to each of the three applications: `zuul-gateway`, `greeting-hystrix`, and `fortune-service`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This will ensure that our services communicate their http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/1.2.0.RELEASE/#_terminology[spans^] to a collector service.


== Setup a Zipkin Collector application to visualize traces

. Visit http://start.spring.io[the Spring Initializr^] and create a new Spring Boot application, as follows:

.. Name the artifact `zipkin-collector`
.. Set the groupId to `io.pivotal`
.. Add the following dependencies
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.zipkin.java</groupId>
  <artifactId>zipkin-autoconfigure-ui</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.zipkin.java</groupId>
  <artifactId>zipkin-server</artifactId>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

. As usual, click btn:[Generate Project], and unpack the zip file alongside our other applications in the `spring-cloud-services-labs` directory.


[NOTE]
.Possible Missing Dependency
====
The latest version of spring initalizr no longer makes the zipkin-server dependency available.  Instead, they recommend that a zipkin server be obtained directly from the open-zipkin project here:  https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin#quick-start[^]

If you're unable to get a spring boot app with the above dependencies working, then instead simply follow the above-linked quick-start instructions to `wget` the artifact and start it from the command line with a `java -jar` command.  This artifact is pre-configured as a zipkin server that listens on the right port (9411).
====

== Configure the Zipkin Collector

. Add the annotation `@EnableZipkinServer` to the Spring Boot Application class

. For convenience, and so that we don't have to configure each of our client applications with the zipkin collector url, let's configure the application to start on the default port: 9411.  One way to do this is to rename the `application.properties` file to `application.yml` and editing it so that it looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 9411
----

== Start up "all the things"

As usual, let's stand up our system, starting with:

- config-server
- service-registry
- zipkin-collector

Then our services:

- fortune-service
- greeting-hystrix

And finally our edge service:

- zuul-gateway

Let's make sure that everything is working as intended:

- Visit the http://localhost:8787/[fortune-service^] a few times in a browser
- Visit the http://localhost:8080/[greeting application^] a few times and make sure it can connect to the fortune service to render fortunes
- Visit the same greeting app, but this time http://localhost:8200/greeting-hystrix[via our zuul gateway^].  Refresh the page 3-4 times for good measure.


== Check out the Zipkin Server UI

Visit the http://localhost:9411/[Zipkin UI^] in a browser.  You might have to wait up to a minute.  Since our applications have been configured with the zipkin client dependency, they will attempt by default to send their trace data to the zipkin server.

From the pulldown menu, select the `zull-gateway` service, and click btn:[Find Traces].  The search results should display a trace of the "end-to-end" call across all three services, as shown below.

Now, drill down into that trace by clicking on the listed trace, and you should see a visualization similar to the one shown here:

Aside from the basic call trace, note that call duration information is displayed (e.g. 3ms spent in the fotune service).  Also, there's color-coding at play:  any calls that throw an exception will display in dark red instead of blue (which signifies a successful call).  Clicking on the trace will display a popup window containing even more information about this trace.

As the number of microservices in our ecosystem grows, such trace visualizations become indispensable to help make sense of our system's behavior.

Congratulations!  You've completed this lab.
