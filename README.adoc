This repository contains a version of the 2-Day Spring Cloud Services course, ported to asciidoc.

To generate the course as html:

----
gradle asciidoctor
----

To generate a PDF version of the course materials:

----
gradle -b build-pdf.gradle asciidoctor
----

After reviewing and modifying the `manifest.yml` file, you can publish the html version of the course contents to PCF with the following command:

----
cf push
----

At the moment, a version of this course is published to https://scs.cfapps.io/[this url^].

Thanks.
